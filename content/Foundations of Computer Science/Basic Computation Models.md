## Turing Machine
- A machine operates on a **infinite** tape. On this tape are symbols, which the machine can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a **finite** set of elementary instructions.![](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/turing/www/turing.gif)
- Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.(Incredibly powerful)

### Universal Turing Machine

A Universal Turing Machine can simulate any arbitrary Turing machine on arbitrary input.
- A Turing machine computes a certain fixed partial computable function.
- A Turing Machine has **finite** states. Hence, we're capable of encoding those states.
- Programable: by reading both the description of the machine to be simulated as well as the input from its own tape.

Given the appropriate program, a Universal Turing Machine is capable of computing anything that is computable.

### Turing Equivalance

2 computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P.

### Turing Complete

A system that can simulate a universal Turing machine is called Turing complete.
- Examples: Most programming languages if memory limit is ignored. E.g. C, C++, Python...
- Non Turing complete languages: regular languages generated by regular expression, context free grammar

### Misc
- [Movie: The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)

## Von Neumann Model
Developed based on UTM.
![](https://i.imgur.com/73Tb6aQ.png)

- 4 main components: CU, ALU, memory, I/O
- Programs must be stored in the memory.
- Finite instructions(why?)
- Sequential execution: instructions will be fetched, decoded, and executed one after another, even if there is a jump to previous/following instructions.
    - e.g.
        1. jump to 4
        2. add x and y
        3. jump to 2
        4. jump to 2

## Questions
1. What's a Turing Machine?
2. Is a calculator Turing complete? Give an explaination.
3. Explain the Von Neumann Model.
