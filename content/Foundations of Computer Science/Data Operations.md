- Example: 15, -15

## Questions

1. Let X and Y be 39 and 127 respectively. Both are 8-bit **unsigned** numbers.
    1. Apply 1-bit logical/arithmetic left/right shift on X and Y. Show the process in binary format.
    2. Apply NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR on X and Y. Show the process in binary format.
2. Show the results of problem 1. Conditions are the same, except that both numbers are now **signed**.

## [Arithmetic Operations](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~smoler/x86text/lect.notes/arith.int.html)

- Integer: 2's complement
- Float: Sign and magnitude
- 1's complement

## Questions

1. Show the following processes in binary format:
    1. 8-bit integer:
        - 102 + 23
        - -23 + 3
        - -163 - 134
    2. IEEE 754:
        - 34.75 + 23.125
        - -34.75 + 23.125
        - 34.75 - 23.125
        - -34.75 - 23.125
