#	`sshfs`

-	`-o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=5,ServerAliveCountMax=3`
-	Mac requires [osxfuse](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse) and the option, `defer_permissions`[^defer_permissions], to work correctly.

#	Basic Laravel File Structure

-	`routes/web.php`: routing control
-	`resources/views`: blade template system(section, yield, include)
-	`public`: stores contents that is accessible by anyone.
-	`storage`: stores to-be-managed contents.
-	`.env`: basic environment settings
-	`php artisan down/up`: website accessibility.
