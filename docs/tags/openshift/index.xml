      <description>Motivation Our school was going to hold a competitive programming contest. This time we were choosing Domjudge in favor of PC^2 as our judging system. The former is an open source project, which is pretty convenient for us to modify its content to suite our needs. About its robustness, it was the judging system for ICPC World Final 2019. Our contest was split into 2 groups. Both groups have their own database, server, and judge hosts.</description>
